***Work in progress*** A 2D JavaFX multiplayer online game

Two player, turn based game, with socket-based online functionality and a MySQL database storing game records and rankings. The goal is to destroy an enemy artillery station placed on a 2D map, by shooting a single bullet each turn. Bullet's explosion can alter terrain.

Interface is done in JavaFX with FXML and SceneBuilder's help.
